                    <div style="text-align:left">
                    <p>The CWRU TKD Club came to be on the campus of CWRU in the early 1980's. CWRU students, faculty and friends who were experienced martial artists came together to train, learn and grow through their common interest in the martial arts. Originally, the club was merely an on-campus special interest group that struggled with finding places adequate for training. Thwing Ballroom was an early training site for the club, which moved to Wade Commons in the late 80's until 1998 when the club moved to its present training area in Veale Center.
</br></br>Various club hardships over the years gave way to times of prosperity. Yet the club of friends persevered and adopted the unofficial moniker "The Phoenix". The Phoenix became many things to the many new members that joined over the years. New members found that the fellowship and philosophies encountered in training carried into their everyday lives. Thus, the Phoenix has positively impacted academic and professional careers by providing a means to cope with daily encountered stress. With time the club evolved to became more than a special interest club and beyond a mere sports club.
</br></br>Today, the club has a strong membership comprised of CWRU students, faculty and the occasional visiting Alum. Case Taekwondo welcomes Taekwondo practitioners from all backgrounds, including Independent schools, the World Taekwondo Federation, and International Taekwon-Do Federation. The club has been, and continues to be, a source of life-long friendships, a few marriages and more than a few job leads.
</br></br>Case Taekwondo has been a well-respected member of the Northeast Ohio Martial Arts Community for several decades. The club has a history of competing in various tournaments in Northeast Ohio but has been dormant competitive-wise in the past several years. The Case Taekwondo Club is currently engaged in reorganizing a competitive program and hopes to begin competing again in the 2015-2016 academic year.
